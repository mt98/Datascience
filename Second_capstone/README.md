# Predicting Parkinson Disease metrics UPDRS scores at a given time point using protein and peptide data 
# 1. Data
**The data has been downloaded from a kaggle competition using the following url: {(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amp-parkinsons-disease-progression-prediction/data.)}
The  data had  248 patients with protein measurements (NPX values) for 234 proteins and peptide abundances for 968 peptides. The data was collected across 0,6,12 and 24 months, with all time points not available for each patient.**
